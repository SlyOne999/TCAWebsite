Build
--------------------------------------------------
HTML/CSS/JS
Responsive framework was built using Bootstrap.
Adjustments and styles were made using CSS along with media querys at the bottom of the stylesheet for small devices.
Javascript from the accordion was a plugin from W3 Schools so didn't need any editing.
Footer year date will update automatically via javascript which can be found on YouTube.
