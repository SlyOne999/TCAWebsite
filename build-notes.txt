Build
--------------
HTML/CSS/JS
Responsive framework was built using Bootstrap which makes life easier.
Adjustments and styles were made using CSS along with a media query at the bottom of the stylesheet for small devices.
Javascript from the accordion was a plugin from W3 Schools so didn't need any editing.
Footer year date will update automatically via javascript which can be found on YouTube.
